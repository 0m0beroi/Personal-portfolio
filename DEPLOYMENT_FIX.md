# Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue Identified
Your Vercel deployment is showing the bundled server code instead of your React application. This is because:

1. The static files are not being served correctly in production
2. The build output directory configuration was incorrect
3. Contact form links had placeholder values

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Server Configuration (`server/index.ts`)
- Fixed host binding for production (0.0.0.0 instead of localhost)
- This allows Vercel to properly bind to the deployment environment

### 2. Contact Information (`ContactSection.tsx`)
- Fixed email link: `mailto:0m0beroi04@gmail.com`
- Fixed phone link: `tel:+918081378585` (removed spaces/dashes)
- Kept the Google Maps link as provided

### 3. Build Configuration (`vercel.json`)
- Created proper Vercel configuration
- Set correct routing for API and static files
- Configured production environment variables

### 4. Static File Serving (`server/vite.ts`)
- Fixed the build directory path to look in the correct location
- Changed from `"public"` to `"../dist/public"`

### 5. Package Scripts (`package.json`)
- Added `vercel-build` script for Vercel deployment
- This ensures the client builds correctly during deployment

## Next Steps

### To Deploy the Fixed Version:

1. **Commit all changes to your repository:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment configuration and contact links"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Click on your project (0m0beroi)
   - Go to the "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
   - Or push to your main branch to trigger automatic deployment

3. **Verify the deployment:**
   Visit https://0m0beroi.vercel.app/ after redeployment

## Expected Result
After redeployment, your website should show:
- ✅ Your React portfolio application (not server code)
- ✅ Proper glassmorphism design and animations
- ✅ Working navigation and all sections
- ✅ Functional contact form with correct email/phone links
- ✅ All project pages and portfolio features

## If Issues Persist
If you still see server code after redeployment:
1. Check Vercel build logs for errors
2. Ensure all files are committed and pushed to GitHub
3. Try a fresh deployment from the Vercel dashboard

The main issue was that Vercel was serving the wrong files. These fixes should resolve the deployment completely.
