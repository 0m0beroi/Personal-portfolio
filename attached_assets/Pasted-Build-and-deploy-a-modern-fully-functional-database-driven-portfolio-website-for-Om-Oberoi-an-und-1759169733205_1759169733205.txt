Build and deploy a modern, fully-functional, database-driven portfolio website for Om Oberoi, an undergraduate (B.Tech in Electronics & Communication Engineering, BBDNIIT, Graduating 2027). The goal is to showcase Om’s expertise in Electronics, Embedded Systems, and Computer Science through a sleek, interactive portfolio, hosted entirely on Replit.

Technology Stack (Replit-Compatible)
Frontend: React (using Replit’s React template or via Nix environment), styled with TailwindCSS (glassmorphism utilities enabled).

Backend: Node.js + Express.js running in the Replit server.js.

Database: MongoDB Atlas (remote cloud DB, connected via MONGO_URI secret).

Authentication: Admin login secured with JWT tokens.

Hosting: Entire MERN project served from Replit with a public URL.

Core Features
Theme Switcher: Dark/Light toggle with animated transitions.

Glassmorphism Design: Semi-transparent, frosted-glass navigation, cards, and forms.

Admin Dashboard: JWT-secured pages to manage portfolio content (add/update/delete Projects, Skills, Services, and Messages).

Dynamic Rendering: Portfolio data (projects, skills, contact messages) pulled from MongoDB Atlas.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Replit Deployment Instructions
Setup Project Structure

In Replit, create a Node.js project and initialize React frontend.

Structure:

text
/frontend  → React + TailwindCSS  
/backend   → Express API server (server.js)  
Install Dependencies

Backend: express, mongoose, jsonwebtoken, bcryptjs, cors, dotenv.

Frontend: react, react-dom, axios, tailwindcss.

Database Configuration

Use MongoDB Atlas connection string as secret in Replit (MONGO_URI).

Authentication

Implement JWT-based login for /admin.

Protect routes for managing Projects, Skills, and Messages.

Environment Variables

Add in Replit Secrets:

MONGO_URI (MongoDB Atlas Connection String)

JWT_SECRET (random secure string for token signing)

Run & Host

Use concurrently or a Replit Procfile to start both frontend and backend.

Example script in package.json:

json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node backend/server.js",
  "frontend": "cd frontend && npm start",
  "dev": "concurrently \"npm run start\" \"npm run frontend\""
}
Live site becomes accessible at the Replit public URL.

Goal
Deliver a Replit-hosted MERN portfolio website with:

Dynamic content from MongoDB Atlas

JWT-secured admin dashboard

Glassmorphism + theme toggle

Fully responsive UI to showcase Om Oberoi's academic and technical strengths
